My name is Helmar
As a Level 3 Support associate for Amazon, I excel at handling complex queries and escalated issues from our premium sellers. In my spare time, I am passionate about staying up-to-date on the latest technologies and enjoy building apps with Astro.js and Next.js. 
With a love for travel, I have visited 68 countries and bring a diverse perspective to my work. Whether at home or abroad, I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow.
This blog is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio.
