If you're a business owner in 2024 or just a blogger and you're not satisfied with your website's performance, 
these articles might be for you. Maybe you've invested a lot of time and effort into creating a beautiful website 
with a tool like Wordpress or Wix, but it's not generating the results you hoped for. 
Even if you are getting some traction, there is always room for improvement. In this blog, 
I'll explain why using a Framwork like Next.js, Ionic, Svelte or Astro is the best choice for building a strong web presence.
As a backend you can either chose Google Cloud Services, Netlify, Vercel or AWS.
